4, impact of climate change on lake 
 Climate change has many negative effects on lake, It consists following ideal: 
 -> first , It makes the water warmer
 Lake becomes hoter, leading to less oxygen in the water, so that it harder for fishes to breathe. Some aquatic animals
cannot survive in higher temperature. "From all the above points, we can see that 
it reduces the number of species in the ecosystem."
 ->second, Water level change 
  As the temperature increases, more water evaporates into the air. It causes many issues, with two of them being the following.
Sometimes this causes too much rain in other areas, leading to floods. On the other hand, once a lake has completely 
evaporated, there won't enough water left in the area, causing a drought.  
 -> finally is dirty water. Which can negatively affect many people and creatures.
  Did you know?, warm water can cause green slime algae, which is toxic to people and animals.
More specifically, for animals, fish and other wildlife are dying due to a depletion of oxygen in the water from rotting algae.
For human, They can use dirty water for drinking and farming, causing many dangerous diseases that makes life more difficult.
 5, How the ecosystem is affected 
  The first is Habitat Shifts. We can see that when the temperature rises, some animals must move to a stuiable environment or adapt to the new one.
However, those that fail to do so will slowly be led to extinction. Second , we have changes in species behavior.
From documentary TV program, news, or books, we know that several animals are changing mating,
migration and hibernations times to suit the new climate, Third, they can cause extremely weather
