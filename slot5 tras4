4, impact of climate change on lake 
 Climate change has many negative effects on lake, It consists following ideal: 
 -> first , It makes the water warmer
 Lake becomes hoter, leading to less oxygen in the water, so that it harder for fishes to breathe. Some aquatic animals
cannot survive in higher temperature. "From all the above points, we can see that 
it reduces the number of species in the ecosystem."
 ->second, Water level change 
  As the temperature increases, more water evaporates into the air. It causes many issues, with two of them being the following.
Sometimes this causes too much rain in other areas, leading to floods. On the other hand, once a lake has completely 
evaporated, there won't enough water left in the area, causing a drought.  
 -> finally is dirty water. Which can negatively affect many people and creatures.
  Did you know?, warm water can cause green slime algae, which is toxic to people and animals.
We can understand that, it make people and animal 's are more difficult

5, How the ecosystem is affected 
first is Habitat Shifts. We can see that when the temperature rises, 
some animals must move to a stuiable environment or adapt to the new one.
However, those that fail are at rick of extinction. 
Second , we have changes in species behavior.
From documentary TV program, news, or books, we know that several animals are changing mating,
migration and hibernations times to suit the new climate, 
Third, they can cause extremely weather
4. Ocean Effects
Global warming makes the ocean hotter.
Ice melts, sea levels rise, and storms get stronger.
This harms sea creatures and changes ocean life.
5. Loss of Biodiversity
Because of warmer water
Many fish and sea animals, plant can’t survive.
We are losing many marine species — this is a loss of biodiversity.
6. Disrupted Ecosystem Services
The ocean helps us breathe, eat, and stay cool.
But global warming damages the ocean.
Then, it can’t give us clean air, food, or climate balance like before.
